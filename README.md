## The Model
A heterogeneous households general equilibrium model featuring both life cycle and dynastic elements is calibrated to replicate some characteristics of the Spanish economy and used to evaluate potential reforms of the tax system.

## [!] Data Disclaimer

Due to confidentiality clauses related to the data I use in my work, I cannot provide you with such data as you may suspect. As to the calibration, I can assure you will find some numbers in the literature for many parameters of the model. But income and wealth distributional parameters will require you to have microdata to properly calibrate the model and evaluate the theoretical results with real data.
